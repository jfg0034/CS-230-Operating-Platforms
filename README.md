# Final Journal
The Gaming Room was the company owner of “Draw It or Lose It”, a mobile application that was originally only available in Android devices. This client wanted to expand and allow the application to be able to be run on multiple platforms.

I believe I was able to identify the design constraints that would shape how the project should be developed, as well as identifying a proper operating system that would host the server of the game.

It was helpful to know how the client envisioned the structure of its application, as well as how it was meant for the application to handle and organize all the data input.
I would probably pick which would be the best way to manage storage. Although I believe I pointed out one way of allocation method, I think I was mostly focused on the management of the image library rather than other resources such as list of teams and players. I would probably analyze further how new data should be updated in the most efficient way as possible.

I considered how the user would receive the images during the game, for instance, which allowed me to consider using the “lazy loading” technique. I also though about how the user would be added to a team and how security measures should be taken. User needs are important because, after all, the application is made to be used by them, and it is always expected to provide the best experience as possible.

I first started analyzing how the game is supposed to take place and everything else that the client provided us. With this in mind, I set the guidelines to be followed when developing the code, such as how games, teams, and players are organized within the program. I also analyzed the different advantages and disadvantages of the operating systems, which helped me see which one seemed to be more fit for this project.
